## What is Pashto DAO?

Pashto DAO is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). It's dedicated to building an autonomous, transparent, and inclusive community for the widespread adoption of the Pashto language. In this community-driven initiative, every member has an equal voice in shaping the governance. We aim to work in a distributed structure, without a centralized leadership structure.

## The Untapped Potential of Pashto

Over 70 million people worldwide speak the Pashto language, yet it remains a low-resource language, with limited digital content and tools available online. This presents a significant opportunity to empower Pashto speakers and bring their language to the forefront of the digital landscape.

## Our Mission: Advancing Pashto in the Digital Sphere

Pashto DAO's primary goal is to create a vibrant community that drives the development of digital products and services for the Pashto language. This includes initiatives such as Automatic Speech Recognition, transcription, digital dictionaries, grammar correction, and text-to-speech systems, all powered by open-source projects and volunteer contributions.

## The Path Ahead: A Roadmap for Success

To achieve our ambitious goals, Pashto DAO has outlined a clear roadmap, with specific milestones to be reached each quarter. This includes:

1. Crowdsourcing the creation of Pashto language sentences, voice clips, and their validation for the Common Voice project
2. Crowdsourcing the creation and validation of Pashto language sentences for the Aya project
3. Creating a Phonetic Pashto keyboard for mobile, web, and desktop with a Pashto spell checker
4. Incorporating an open source Pashot digital dictionary
5. Createing a unified approach to Latinisation of the Pashto language
6. Training and improving Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR/STT) models for Pashto
7. Training and improving Text To Speech (TTS) models for Pashto
8. Establishing a systimatic approach to Pashto language corpus creation
9. Createing a chatGPT like model for Pashto
10. Creating a unified digital assistant like Siri for Pashto

Long term goals include:

1. Creating content in Pashto (AI, Blockchain, Science, Art, Learning, Research, etc.)
2. Creating a Pashto Story telling/film/theater department
3. Building a community driven news/citizen journalist organisation where local volunteer will report, verify news
4. Lobbying for enlisting Pashtoon culture (Naan, chapli kebab, Kabuli Pulao, Amrasa, Ghati Wreji)
5. Creating a worldwide Pashtoon charity that will help Pashtoons
6. Onboarding volunteers and community mobilisers for the above projects
