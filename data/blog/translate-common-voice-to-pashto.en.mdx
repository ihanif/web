Adding a new language to the Mozilla Common Voice project involves several stages. We have already completed the first stage by adding Pashto as a language and making it available to the list of languages.

However, we need to complete the following stages before people can start contributing their voices to the Pashto voice dataset:

1. Translate Common Voice Page for Pashto
2. Add or review sentences in Pashto for the voice dataset
3. Record in your voice the sentences added in step 2

Here we will discuss the first step only. We will add details for the other steps and provide links here when they are ready.

## Translate Common Voice Page to Pashto

Each language on Common Voice has its page, usually accessed through its [ISO 639-1 codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes). For example, Pashto's ISO 639-1 code is `ps`. Therefore, we can access the Pashto Common Voice page at https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/ps.

As you can see from this page at https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/ps/about, it has some sections in English and some in Pashto because we still need to complete the translation to Pashto. You can contribute to this translation project by following the following steps:

1. Go to the Pashto translation project (Pontoon) at https://pontoon.mozilla.org/ps
2. Create an account by clicking the `Sign in` button at the top right.
3. It will take you to a login page where you can create an account by entering your email.
4. Once you have created the account, log in by clicking the `Sign in` button again https://pontoon.mozilla.org/ps
5. After logging in, you can click on the `UNREVIEWED` link to review translated sentences.

6. Two volunteers (members) must approve each translated sentence before the translation project accepts it as a correct translation.
7. You can approve a sentence by clicking on the `Approve` button below the translated Pashto text in the text area. If you can't see the approve button, you need to request access as a translator at https://app.element.io/#/room/#common-voice:mozilla.org group.

8. You might also come across sentences in English that still need to be translated. You can provide a grammatically correct translation for these sentences in the text area and click the `Suggest` button.
