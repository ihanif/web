Today is a great day for the Pashto language. Pashto is finally available for voice recordings on Mozilla Common Voice. It took more than two years to achieve this milestone. Finally, we have completed the crucial stage and are ready to collect voice clips from Pashto speakers.

## Donate your voice recordings

Please donate your voice if you can read and speak the Pashto language. You can do so by following these steps:

1. Please go to this link at https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/ps/speak.
2. You should see a sentence written in Pashto and a mic button below it. Please don't press the mic button yet.
3. Please read the sentence aloud to practice before the actual recording. It ensures no complex words will cause long pauses in the recording.
4. Please make sure there are no loud background noises. Once you're ready, press the mic button to start recording.
5. Now read out loud the sentence shown on the screen. Once you finish a sentence, please press the stop button.
6. As you press stop, it will take you to the next sentence. Please follow the steps you did for the first sentence.
7. After recording five sentences, please review by clicking the play button close to each sentence. If you are unhappy with the previous recording, press the refresh button and record again.
8. Once happy with all five sentences, press the submit (وسپارئ) button at the bottom.

Thanks for contributing to adopting the Pashto language on the internet and voice-enabled devices. Please record more sentences either on a daily or weekly basis.
