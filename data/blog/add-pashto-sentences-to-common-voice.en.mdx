Adding a new language to the Mozilla Common Voice project involves several stages. We have already completed the first stage by adding Pashto as a language and making it available to the list of languages.

However, we need to complete the following stages before people can start contributing their voices to the Pashto voice dataset:

1. Translate Common Voice Page for Pashto
2. Add or review sentences in Pashto for the voice dataset

Here we will discuss the second step only.

### Add new sentences to Common Voice Pashto Dataset

1. Please go to the Pashto sentence collection project at https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/sentence-collector/#/ps

2. Create an account or log in by clicking the `Collect sentences` link.

3. It will take you to a login page where you can create an account by entering your email or Mozilla account details if you have already created one.

4. Once you have created the account, or logged in, click the `Collect sentences` link.

5. You can now add single or multiple sentences (on a new line).

6. Please submit and confirm the submission on the next screen. `Without confirmation, the system won't save your sentences, and you will lose all the effort`.

7. Two volunteers (members) must approve each sentence before the project accepts it as a correct sentence for the voice dataset.

### Review already added sentences for Common Voice Pashto Dataset

1. Please go to https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/sentence-collector/#/ps/review

2. Create an account or log in by clicking the `Collect sentences` link.

3. It will take you to a login page where you can create an account by entering your email or Mozilla account details if you have already created one.

4. Once you have created the account, or logged in, click the `Review sentences` link.

5. You can now review sentences by clicking on the `Approve`, `Skip`, or `Reject` buttons below the shown sentence.

6. Two volunteers (members) must approve each sentence before the project accepts it as a correct sentence for the voice dataset.

7. Please click the `Finish Review` button after reviewing single or multiple sentences. `Without clicking this button, the system won't save your review session, and you will lose all the review effort`.
